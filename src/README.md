# ProductionLineTrackerGui
## Production Line Tracker OOP
This program is software for a media player production facility.
I am programming this as my first object oriented project in my junior year at Florida Gulf Coast University.

## Sprint 1 
During this sprint, in the development of the media player production, 
I implement Gui into the project by adding buttons, a comboBox and text fields. 
This sprint also involves connecting to a database for the first time, inserting values 
and displaying those values to the console.

## Getting Started

In order to get this project running, on your local computer for demonstration/testing, 
you must have Intellij (IDE) installed on your computer. 
Once you have that installed, you will get the link to this repository and pull it to you
intellij program to get it running.

## Key Programming Concepts Utilized

In this program, I utilized the concepts that I learned in Java in my Object Oriented Programming class.
I've used scene builder to help me build my program environment, and a css file to create a custom look to the environment.
 I've connected to the database and inserted values to it.
